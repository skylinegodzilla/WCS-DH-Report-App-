# WCS-DH-Report-App-

This is a project I did for Wanganui Collegiate school in 2016 to automate the search through large CSV data exports from there databases to find out what students were going to the dining hall when they should not be.
The administration used to try go this data in excel however the computers would grind to a crawl when searching through the data.
This app loads the information first from a CSV file in to data tables then sorts through the information that they quarry in a much more efficient way saving time and hassle.
They can then latter on export the quarryâ€™s as CSV or xls files.
The app is written in VB inside visual studio

Its desinged for a paticuler database there for I have uploaded this for example purposes.
